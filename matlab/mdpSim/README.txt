ABOUT
-----
This simulator is written for MATLAB and allows one to simulate the 
Markov Decision Process (MDP) of an agent interacting with its environment. 
Three example MDP's are included. The first two, windyGridworld and 
mineSweeper, are textbook problems commonly used to teach Reinforcement 
Learning concepts. The third problem, radioNetworks, is an abstraction
of the type of MDP that can be solved by the tdma-rlagent in ExtRaSy.

HOW TO RUN
----------
1) Open MATLAB
2) Add the simulator directories to the MATLAB path
3) Run one of the scripts found in ../problems
